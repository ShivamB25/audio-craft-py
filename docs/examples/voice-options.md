            "voice_name": VoiceName.GACRUX,  # Mature
            "speed": 0.8,                    # Slower
            "pitch": 0.9                     # Lower pitch
        }
    )
    
    # Fast, high, energetic voice
    request = AudioRequest(
        text="Exciting news! Limited time offer!",
        voice_config={
            "voice_name": VoiceName.FENRIR,  # Excitable

        }

## üéµ Testing Voice Options

Use the provided test script to hear all voices:

```bash
python test_voice_options.py
```

This will generate sample audio files for different voice characteristics, allowing you to hear the differences and choose the best voice for your needs.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Match Voice to Content**: Choose voices that complement your content's tone and purpose
2. **Test Before Production**: Generate samples with different voices to find the perfect match
3. **Consider Your Audience**: Younger audiences might prefer upbeat voices, while professional content benefits from firm or informative voices
4. **Combine with Speed/Pitch**: Fine-tune the voice further with speed and pitch adjustments
5. **Consistency**: Use the same voice throughout a project for consistency

## üîÑ Voice Switching Example

```python
async def dynamic_voice_content():
    """Example showing different voices for different parts of content."""
    tts = TTSService()
    
    # Introduction - Warm and welcoming
    intro = AudioRequest(
        text="Welcome to our audio guide!",
        voice_config={"voice_name": VoiceName.SULAFAR},
        output_filename="01_intro.wav"
    )
    
    # Main content - Clear and informative
    content = AudioRequest(
        text="In this section, we'll cover the key concepts.",
        voice_config={"voice_name": VoiceName.CHARON},
        output_filename="02_content.wav"
    )
    
    # Conclusion - Bright and positive
    conclusion = AudioRequest(
        text="Thank you for listening! We hope this was helpful.",
        voice_config={"voice_name": VoiceName.ZEPHYR},
        output_filename="03_conclusion.wav"
    )
    
    # Generate all parts
    for request in [intro, content, conclusion]:
        result = await tts.generate_audio(request)
        if result.success:
            print(f"‚úÖ Generated: {result.file_path}")

asyncio.run(dynamic_voice_content())
```

This approach allows you to create more engaging content by using different voices for different purposes within the same project.
